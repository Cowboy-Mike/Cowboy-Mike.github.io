I don't know why it took me so long to get into this field. In every role during my professional career I was always submitting recommendations, suggestions, or creating work arounds to get different programs working the way I needed them to. Sometimes it was simple features that were missing, others were entire processes and I became really skilled at developing a work around or developing a process that enabled me to complete what I needed to get done with the tools I had. In a way it was my own development but I was working around what someone else had already created. As I took on more responsibilities and my work arounds became more solidified and integral to our operations I realized that this was my own flavor of development. I was developing a process around a program that someone already built and it was a square peg in a round hole scenario, sure it could fit but not well. This was the turning point for me when I decided to pursue this as a full time career. I found a Flat Iron and decided to pursue my goal and I think this is going to an amazing journey.
